# AB-Testing
A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a method of comparing two variants(A and B) to determine which one performs better. In A/B testing, two variants (A and B) are created with one element of the design or content being different between the two variants. The two versions are then shown randomly to users, and their behavior is monitored and compared to determine which variant performs better based on a predefined goal, such as the conversion rate, click-through rate, or engagement rate.

A/B testing is commonly used in website optimization, digital marketing, and product development to determine which variant is more effective at achieving a specific goal. It helps businesses make data-driven decisions by providing insight into what resonates better with their audience and what changes can be made to improve the user experience and increase conversions.
